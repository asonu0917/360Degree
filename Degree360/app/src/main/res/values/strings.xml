  <string name="paragraph2">The eponymous genus Gorilla is divided into two
    species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas, and either four or
    five subspecies. They are the largest living primates by physical size.

\n\nThe DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95–99%
    depending on what is counted, and they are the next closest living relatives
    to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.

\n\nGorillas\' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa.
    Although their range covers a small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a
    wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift
    montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude
    from 2,200–4,300 metres (7,200–14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense
    forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western
    lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland
    gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda
